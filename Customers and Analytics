#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
